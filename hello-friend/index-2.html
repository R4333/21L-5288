<p>My name is R433, or Muhammad Abdullah and I&rsquo;m the author of this blog. I made it to help me present my ideas better.</p>
<p>We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create the content.</p>
<p>This site is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials. All I have to do is start typing!</p>
<p>This site was a failed attempt at creating a blog a few month ago, which I had to abandon as I wasn't able to afford hosting on a MEAN Stack based host. In the end I resorted to hosting a wordpress based site on a free LAMP stack shared hosting service and this blog was left collecting dust.</p>
<p>The basic layout of the blog was created with SASS and javascript using node.js, with code collected from several sources, which was then mish-mashed into this blog. The sites stylesheet was then integrated with HUGO which is a open-source headless Content Management System and a static site generator, using which the posts in the blog were created. It was installed as a npm package in node.js. It was done so to ease the process of making different pages for the blog posts and to save time. These HTML pages were then transplanted to my sites directory structure to integrate it with the landing page/portfolio.</p>
<p>The landing page/Portfolio was created using pure CSS and HTML. Bootstrap CSS and JS libraries were used. Bootstrap was implemented using the CDN method. The whole site was created in a span of  hours, overnight. For the portfolio page, help was taken from bootstraps official documentations and examples. otherthan that, I tried to use Randomuser.me API to get random information for the team section of the page but I couldn't properly implement it. In the end, I just href-ed user images from the Randomuser.me's database and put placeholder text. I also implemented a map using mapbox which is also not properly implemented as it's not centering the map on the desired location but onto boston where mapbox's parent company is based in. I changed the centering coordinates to someplace in antarctica but it still isn't working. I think these scripts need a working node.js back-end to work. it is out of the scope of this assignment. My mapbox API key/Access Token is embedded into the page, I hope you don't extract the Access Token, send requests with that key and lapse my requests quota on mapbox. lol.  </p>
<p>I plan to implement a JS based in-browser PlayStation 1 or GBA or some other retro console emulator into the site. right now, the candidate in my eyes is eNGE PS1 emulator.</p>
<p>This site is an ode to Sam Esmail's TV series, Mr. Robot.</p>
<p>The site includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>light/dark mode</strong>, depending on your preferences</li>
<li>great reading experience thanks to <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/"><strong>Inter font</strong></a>, made by <a href="https://rsms.me/about/">Rasmus Andersson</a></li>
<li>nice code highlighting thanks to <a href="https://prismjs.com/"><strong>PrismJS</strong></a></li>
<li>integrated a JS implementation of <a href="life-master/index.html"><strong>Conway's Game of Life</strong></a> in the site.</li>
<li>integrated JS based <a href="skifree/index.html">Skifree Game</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So, there you have it&hellip; enjoy!</p>
